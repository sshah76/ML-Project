# ML-Project
# Airbnb Price Prediction

# Overview

This project aims to analyze and predict Airbnb rental prices based on various features such as location, property type, amenities, and seasonal trends. By leveraging machine learning models, we seek to provide data-driven insights that help hosts optimize their pricing strategies and assist travelers in making informed booking decisions.

# Key Objectives

Understand the factors influencing Airbnb listing prices.

Develop predictive models to estimate rental prices.

Provide actionable insights for price optimization.

Analyze seasonal trends and demand fluctuations in short-term rentals.

# Dataset

The dataset includes:

Property details (location, type, amenities, etc.).

Historical pricing and booking trends.

Host attributes and listing reviews.

Seasonal and demand-based pricing variations.
